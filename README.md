Hangman Game Documentation

Goal

The goal of the Hangman game is for the player(s) to guess a secret word or phrase by suggesting letters one at a time. The game can be customized to make it easier or harder, and it can also be used for educational purposes, such as learning new vocabulary, improving spelling, and practicing pronunciation 

Rules
The App selects a secret word from a preditermained set of words. The word is represented by a set of dashes, with each dash representing a letter 
The player take turns suggesting letters that might be in the secret word.
If the suggested letter is in the secret word or phrase, it is revealed in its respective position on the dashed line.
If the suggested letter is not in the secret word or phrase, a part of the hangman stick figure is drawn. The game continues until either the word is guessed correctly, or the entire hangman stick figure is drawn.

This React app provides an interactive interface for the Hangman game. The app selects a secret word and the player guesses letters by clicking on them. The app keeps track of the player's progress and displays the hangman stick figure as the player makes incorrect guesses javascript.plainenglish.io.

Below is the basic use of the react ap and how to start it on your end should youi want to play it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
